        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in building
            clean, maintainable, and well-structured software systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my studies, I have worked on academic and personal projects that
            focus on core computer science principles such as object-oriented design,
            data structures, and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently seeking a student or junior position where I can continue
            learning, contribute to real-world products, and grow as a software engineer.
